This lowers the effective Nyquist frequency and introduces aliasing, while naïve low-pass filtering removes task-relevant high-frequency cues. In this study, we present Aliasing-aware Patch Embedding (AaPE), a drop-in patch stem that mitigates aliasing while preserving high-frequency information. AaPE augments standard patch tokens with features produced by a band-limited complex sinusoidal kernel using a two-sided exponential window that dynamically targets alias-prone bands. Frequency and decay parameters of the kernel are estimated from the input, enabling parallel, adaptive subband analysis whose outputs are fused with the standard patch tokens. AaPE integrates seamlessly into the masked teacher-student self-supervised learning. In addition, we combine a multi-mask strategy with a contrastive objective to enforce consistency across diverse mask patterns, stabilizing training. Pre-training on AudioSet followed by fine-tuning evaluation across diverse downstream benchmarks, which spanned categories, such as environmental sounds and other common audio domains. This approach yields state-of-the-art performance on a subset of tasks and competitive results across the remainder. Complementary linear probing evaluation mirrors this pattern, yielding clear gains on several benchmarks and strong performance elsewhere. The collective analysis of these results indicates that AaPE serves to mitigate the effects of aliasing without discarding of informative high-frequency content."}

This requires fundamentally different learning paradigms from pixel-based visual models. Symbolic visual learners parse diagrams into geometric primitives-points, lines, and shapes-whereas pixel-based learners operate on textures and colors. We propose a novel self-supervised symbolic auto-encoder that encodes diagrams into structured primitives and their interrelationships within the latent space, and decodes them through our executable engine to reconstruct the input diagrams. Central to this architecture is Symbolic Hierarchical Process Reward Modeling, which applies hierarchical step-level parsing rewards to enforce point-on-line, line-on-shape, and shape-on-relation consistency. Since vanilla reinforcement learning exhibits poor exploration in the policy space during diagram reconstruction; we thus introduce stabilization mechanisms to balance exploration and exploitation. We fine-tune our symbolic encoder on downstream tasks, developing a neuro-symbolic system that integrates the reasoning capabilities of neural networks with the interpretability of symbolic models through reasoning-grounded visual rewards. Evaluations across reconstruction, perception, and reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: achieving a 98.2% reduction in MSE for geometric diagram reconstruction, surpassing GPT-4o by 0.6% with a 7B model on chart reconstruction, and improving by +13% on the MathGlance perception benchmark, and by +3% on MathVerse and GeoQA reasoning benchmarks."}

While Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising framework, existing methods often struggle with the multi-granularity of tasks (long-term strategy vs. instant actions) and the complexity of large-scale agent interactions. This paper presents a unified Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework that addresses these challenges. First, we establish a baseline using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) within a client-server architecture for real-time action scheduling, with PPO demonstrating superior performance (4.32 avg. goals, 82.9% ball control). Second, we introduce a Hierarchical RL (HRL) structure based on the options framework to decompose the problem into a high-level trajectory planning layer (modeled as a Semi-Markov Decision Process) and a low-level action execution layer, improving global strategy (avg. goals increased to 5.26). Finally, to ensure scalability, we integrate mean-field theory into the HRL framework, simplifying many-agent interactions into a single agent vs. the population average. Our mean-field actor-critic method achieves a significant performance boost (5.93 avg. goals, 89.1% ball control, 92.3% passing accuracy) and enhanced training stability. Extensive simulations of 4v4 matches in the Webots environment validate our approach, demonstrating its potential for robust, scalable, and cooperative behavior in complex multi-agent domains."}

Recently, supervised methods, such as finite scalar quantization (FSQ) trained with ASR loss, have emerged for speech generation. Both approaches leverage pre-trained SFMs, benefiting low-resource tasks such as child ASR.\n  This paper systematically compares supervised and unsupervised semantic speech tokens for child ASR. Results show that supervised methods not only outperform unsupervised ones but even unexpectedly surpass continuous representations, and they perform well even in ultra-low bitrate settings.

Recent work has shown that hybrid rate-temporal coding strategies (particularly those incorporating bit-plane representations of images into traditional rate coding schemes) can significantly improve performance when trained with surrogate backpropagation. Motivated by these findings, this study proposes a hybrid temporal-bit spike coding method that integrates bit-plane decompositions with temporal coding principles. Through extensive experiments across multiple computer vision benchmarks, we demonstrate that blending bit-plane information with temporal coding yields competitive, and in some cases improved, performance compared to established spike-coding techniques.

The node serves to reallocate probability mass toward uncertainty, while preserving desirable properties such as end-to-end training and differentiability. This mechanism provides a natural escape route for highly ambiguous, anomalous, or noisy samples, particularly relevant for instance-dependent and asymmetric label noise. In systematic experiments involving the addition of varying proportions of instance-dependent noise or asymmetric noise to CIFAR-10/100 labels, our drainage formulation achieves an accuracy increase of up to 9\\% over existing approaches in the high-noise regime. Our results on real-world datasets, such as mini-WebVision, mini-ImageNet and Clothing-1M, match or surpass existing state-of-the-art methods.

Furthermore, our drainage formulation enables applications well beyond classification, with immediate benefits for web-scale, semi-supervised dataset cleaning, and open-set applications."}

We also clarified some theoretical foundations, testing new design using quantum data-reupload with different training algorithm-initialization and evaluate the performance of the proposed model under noisy simulated quantum environments. As a result, we were able to achieve 86% of the mean top-performing accuracy of the SOTA SNN baselines, yet uses only 0.5% of the smallest spiking model's parameters.

Yet, many systems and disturbance phenomena are difficult to model due to effects like nonlinearity, chaos, and high-dimensionality. Koopman theory addresses this by modeling the linear evolution of embeddings of the state under an infinite-dimensional linear operator that can be approximated with a suitable finite basis of embedding functions, effectively trading model nonlinearity for representational complexity. However, explicitly computing a good choice of basis is nontrivial, and poor choices may cause inaccurate forecasts or overfitting. To address this, we present Kalman-Implicit Koopman Operator (KALIKO) Learning, a method that leverages the Kalman filter to implicitly learn embeddings corresponding to latent dynamics without requiring an explicit encoder. KALIKO produces interpretable representations consistent with both theory and prior works, yielding high-quality reconstructions and inducing a globally linear latent dynamics.

The protocol works in an asynchronous model where rounds vary in length and have different start times. It works with completely dynamic networks where agents can be faulty. The protocol is the first to converge to an MIS in logarithmic time for dynamic networks in a network oblivious model."}

Project page: https://waabi.ai/flux4d/", "summary": "Reconstructing large-scale dynamic scenes from visual observations is a fundamental challenge in computer vision, with critical implications for robotics and autonomous systems. While recent differentiable rendering methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved impressive photorealistic reconstruction, they suffer from scalability limitations and require annotations to decouple actor motion. Existing self-supervised methods attempt to eliminate explicit annotations by leveraging motion cues and geometric priors, yet they remain constrained by per-scene optimization and sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, we introduce Flux4D, a simple and scalable framework for 4D reconstruction of large-scale dynamic scenes. Flux4D directly predicts 3D Gaussians and their motion dynamics to reconstruct sensor observations in a fully unsupervised manner. By adopting only photometric losses and enforcing an \"as static as possible\" regularization, Flux4D learns to decompose dynamic elements directly from raw data without requiring pre-trained supervised models or foundational priors simply by training across many scenes. Our approach enables efficient reconstruction of dynamic scenes within seconds, scales effectively to large datasets, and generalizes well to unseen environments, including rare and unknown objects. Experiments on outdoor driving datasets show Flux4D significantly outperforms existing methods in scalability, generalization, and reconstruction quality."}

However, its effectiveness is often limited by insufficient trajectory precision due to compounding errors. In this paper, we introduce Grasped Object Manifold Projection (GOMP), an interactive method that mitigates these errors by constraining a non-rigidly grasped object to a lower-dimensional manifold. GOMP assumes a precise task in which a manipulator holds an object that may shift within the grasp in an observable manner and must be mated with a grounded part. Crucially, all GOMP enhancements are learned from the same expert dataset used to train the base IL policy, and are adjusted with an n-arm bandit-based interactive component. We propose a theoretical basis for GOMP's improvement upon the well-known compounding error bound in IL literature. We demonstrate the framework on four precise assembly tasks using tactile feedback, and note that the approach remains modality-agnostic.

Using repeated-measures ANOVA and LASSO regression, we found that therapists were consistently valued for emotional, relational, and personalization benefits, while GAI was favored for accessibility and affordability. Yet structural advantages alone did not predict adoption; emotional benefit and personalization emerged as decisive factors. Adoption patterns diverged across groups: students treated GAI as a complement, whereas national adults approached it as a substitute. Concerns about privacy and reliability constrained GAI use in both groups. These findings extend HBM to multi-modality contexts and highlight design implications for trustworthy, emotionally resonant digital mental health tools."}

Motivated by these observations, we propose Surfel-LIO, which employs a hierarchical voxel structure (hVox) with pre-computed surfel representation. This design enables O(1) correspondence retrieval without runtime neighbor enumeration or plane fitting, combined with Z-order curve encoding for cache-friendly spatial indexing.

A key aspect of this process is identifying distinct biomarkers that define specific cell states. However, difficulties arise from the co-discovery process of cell states and biomarkers: biologists often use dimensionality reduction to visualize cells in a two- dimensional space. Then they usually interpret visually clustered cells as distinct states, from which they seek to identify unique biomarkers. However, this assumption is often invalid due to internal inconsistencies in a cluster, making the process trial-and-error and highly uncertain. Therefore, biologists urgently need effective tools to help uncover the hidden association relationships between different cell populations and their potential biomarkers. To address this problem, we first designed a machine-learning algorithm based on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique to identify meaningful associations between cell populations and biomarkers. We further developed a visual analytics system, CellScout, in collaboration with biologists, to help them explore and refine these association relationships to advance cell state discovery. We validated our system through expert interviews, from which we further selected a representative case to demonstrate its effectiveness in discovering new cell states."}

We introduce a two-stage large language model (LLM) based method for inferring material composition directly from 3D point clouds with coarse segmentations. Our key insight is to decouple reasoning about what an object is from what it is made of. In the first stage, an LLM predicts the object's semantic; in the second stage, it assigns plausible materials to each geometric segment, conditioned on the inferred semantics. Both stages operate in a zero-shot manner, without task-specific training. Because existing datasets lack reliable material annotations, we evaluate our method using an LLM-as-a-Judge implemented in DeepEval. Across 1,000 shapes from Fusion/ABS and ShapeNet, our method achieves high semantic and material plausibility.

While current SLAM and localization systems predominantly rely on sparse representations like point clouds and voxels, dense scene representations are expected to play a critical role in downstream tasks such as navigation and obstacle avoidance. Moreover, neural representations such as NeRF, 3DGS, and foundation models are well-suited for integrating high-level semantic features and language-based priors, enabling more comprehensive 3D scene understanding and embodied intelligence. In this paper, we categorized the core modules of robotics into five parts (Perception, Mapping, Localization, Navigation, Manipulation). We start by presenting the standard formulation of different scene representation methods and comparing the advantages and disadvantages of scene representation across different modules. This survey is centered around the question: What is the best 3D scene representation for robotics? We then discuss the future development trends of 3D scene representations, with a particular focus on how the 3D Foundation Model could replace current methods as the unified solution for future robotic applications. The remaining challenges in fully realizing this model are also explored. We aim to offer a valuable resource for both newcomers and experienced researchers to explore the future of 3D scene representations and their application in robotics.

To address this issue, we introduce EMINDS, a visual analytics system built on a novel automatic mining pipeline that extracts distinct behavior stages and assesses the potential impact of frequent stage patterns on mental health status over time. The system includes a set of interactive visualizations that summarize the meaning of each behavior stage and the evolution of different stage patterns. We feature a pattern-centric Sankey diagram to reveal contextual information about the impact of stage patterns on mental health, helping experts understand the specific changes in sequences before and after a stage pattern.

In this setting, each vertex corresponds to a geometric object, and two vertices are adjacent if and only if their objects intersect. We introduce a new tool for designing such algorithms, which we call a $λ$-linked partition. This is a partition of the vertex set into groups of highly connected vertices. Crucially, such a partition can be computed in polynomial time and does not require access to the geometric representation of the graph. We apply this framework to problems related to paths and cycles in graphs. First, we obtain the first robust ETH-tight algorithms for Hamiltonian Path and Hamiltonian Cycle, running in time $2^{O(n^{1-1/d})}$ on intersection graphs of similarly sized fat objects in $\\mathbb{R}^d$. This resolves an open problem of de Berg et al. [STOC 2018] and completes the study of these problems on geometric intersection graphs from the viewpoint of ETH-tight exact algorithms. We further extend our approach to the parameterized setting and design the first robust subexponential parameterized algorithm for Long Path in any fixed dimension $d$. More precisely, we obtain a randomized robust algorithm running in time $2^{O(k^{1-1/d}\\log^2 k)}\\, n^{O(1)}$ on intersection graphs of similarly sized fat objects in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, where $k$ is the natural parameter.

Learning-based denoisers have the potential to reconstruct high-quality images. For training, however, these denoisers require large paired datasets of clean and noisy images, which are difficult to collect. Noise synthesis is an alternative to large-scale data acquisition: given a clean image, we can synthesize a realistic noisy counterpart. In this work, we propose a general and practical noise synthesis method that requires only one single noisy image and one single dark frame per ISO setting. We represent signal-dependent noise with a Poisson distribution and introduce a Fourier-domain spectral sampling algorithm to accurately model signal-independent noise. The latter generates diverse noise realizations that maintain the spatial and statistical properties of real sensor noise. As opposed to competing approaches, our method neither relies on simplified parametric models nor on large sets of clean-noisy image pairs. Our synthesis method is not only accurate and practical, it also leads to state-of-the-art performances on multiple low-light denoising benchmarks."}

This paper presents a novel model-based RL framework built on top of the DreamerV3 algorithm, integrating a Multi-Layer Perceptron Variational Autoencoder (MLP-VAE) within a world model to encode high-dimensional LIDAR readings into compact latent representations. These latent features, combined with a learned dynamics predictor, enable efficient imagination-based policy optimization. Experiments on simulated TurtleBot3 navigation tasks demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves faster convergence and higher success rate compared to model-free baselines such as SAC, DDPG, and TD3. It is worth emphasizing that the DreamerV3-based agent attains a 100% success rate across all evaluated environments when using the full dataset of the Turtlebot3 LIDAR (360 readings), while model-free methods plateaued below 85%. These findings demonstrate that integrating predictive world models with learned latent representations enables more efficient and robust navigation from high-dimensional sensory data."}

In stressful scenarios for the human operator, such as short decision-making timescales, the risk of failures is exacerbated. A lack of understanding of AI failure modes obstructs this and so blocks the robust implementation of applications of AI in smart systems. This prevents early risk identification, leading to increased time, risk and cost of projects.\n  A key tenet of Systems Engineering and acquisition engineering is centred around a \"left-shift\" in test and evaluation activities to earlier in the system lifecycle, to allow for \"accelerated delivery of [systems] that work\". We argue it is therefore essential that this shift includes the analysis of AI failure cases as part of the design stages of the system life cycle. Our proposed framework enables the early characterisation of risks emerging from human-autonomy teaming (HAT) in operational contexts. The cornerstone of this is a new analysis of AI failure modes, built on the seminal modelling of human-autonomy teams laid out by LaMonica et al., 2022. Using the analysis of the interactions between human and autonomous systems and exploring the failure modes within each aspect, our approach provides a way to systematically identify human-AI interactions risks across the operational domain of the system of interest. The understanding of the emergent behaviour enables increased robustness of the system, for which the analysis should be undertaken over the whole scope of its operational design domain. This approach is illustrated through an example use case for an AI assistant supporting a Command & Control (C2) System."}

However, when performing global localization using semantic objects, high semantic ambiguity intensifies object misclassification and increases the likelihood of incorrect associations, which in turn can cause significant errors in the estimated pose. Thus, in this letter, we propose a multi-label likelihood-based semantic graph matching framework for object-level global localization. The key idea is to exploit multi-label graph representations, rather than single-label alternatives, to capture and leverage the inherent semantic context of object observations. Based on these representations, our approach enhances semantic correspondence across graphs by combining the likelihood of each node with the maximum likelihood of its neighbors via context-aware likelihood propagation. For rigorous validation, data association and pose estimation performance are evaluated under both closed-set and open-set detection configurations. In addition, we demonstrate the scalability of our approach to large-vocabulary object categories in both real-world indoor scenes and synthetic environments."}

While previous research has selectively examined head or hand movements, here we explore movements of the whole body in acoustically adverse conditions. We hypothesized that increasing background noise in conversations would lead to increased gesture frequency in hand, head, trunk, and leg movements typical of conversation. Increased use of hand movements should support the speaker's role, while increased head and trunk movements may help the listener. We conducted a free dyadic conversation experiment with normal-hearing participants (n=8) in a virtual acoustic environment. Conversational movements were described with a newly developed labeling system for typical conversational actions, and the frequency of individual types was analyzed. In addition, we analyzed gesture quality by assessing hand-speech synchrony, with the hypothesis that higher levels of background noise would lead to a loss of synchrony according to an interactive coupling model. Higher noise levels led to increased hand-gesture complexity during speaking and listening, more pronounced up-down head movements, and contrary to expectations, head movements during listening generally decreased relative to speaking. Synchrony and peak velocity were unaffected by noise, while gesture quality scaled only modestly. The results support previous findings regarding gesturing frequency, but we found only limited evidence for changes in speech-gesture synchrony. This work reveals communication patterns of the whole body and illustrates multimodal adaptation to communication demands."}

Non-invasive brain stimulation has garnered attention as it enables direct or indirect modulation of neural activity, thereby promoting sleep enhancement in a safe and unobtrusive manner.

To date, the majority of sleep modulation research relies on open-loop paradigms with empirically determined parameters, while achieving individual adaptation and modulation accuracy remains a distant objective. The paradigm-specific constraints inherent to open-loop designs represent a major obstacle to clinical translation and large-scale deployment in home environments. In this paper, we delineate fundamental paradigms of sleep modulation, critically examine the intrinsic limitations of open-loop approaches, and formally conceptualize sleep closed-loop modulation. We further provide a comprehensive synthesis of prior studies involving five commonly employed modulation techniques, evaluating their potential integration within a closed-loop framework. Finally, we identify three primary challenges in constructing an effective sleep closed-loop modulation system: sensor solution selection, monitoring model design, and modulation strategy design, while also proposing potential solutions.

Traditionally, high-definition (HD) maps are providing this representation of the static road infrastructure to the autonomous system a priori. However, because the real world is constantly changing, such maps must be constructed online from on-board sensor data. Navigation-grade standard-definition (SD) maps are widely available, but their resolution is insufficient for direct deployment. Instead, they can be used as coarse prior to guide the online map construction process. We propose NavMapFusion, a diffusion-based framework that performs iterative denoising conditioned on high-fidelity sensor data and on low-fidelity navigation maps. This paper strives to answer: (1) How can coarse, potentially outdated navigation maps guide online map construction? (2) What advantages do diffusion models offer for map fusion? We demonstrate that diffusion-based map construction provides a robust framework for map fusion. Our key insight is that discrepancies between the prior map and online perception naturally correspond to noise within the diffusion process; consistent regions reinforce the map construction, whereas outdated segments are suppressed. On the nuScenes benchmark, NavMapFusion conditioned on coarse road lines from OpenStreetMap data reaches a 21.4% relative improvement on 100 m, and even stronger improvements on larger perception ranges, while maintaining real-time capabilities. By fusing low-fidelity priors with high-fidelity sensor data, the proposed method generates accurate and up-to-date environment representations, guiding towards safer and more reliable autonomous driving.

Among their daily responsibilities, medication management remains one of the most demanding and error-prone tasks. Non-adherence to prescribed regimens not only undermines patient outcomes but also intensifies caregiver stress, anxiety, and fatigue. Although digital health technologies have proliferated to address adherence, most solutions focus exclusively on patients and neglect the informational and emotional needs of caregivers. This paper introduces Adhera, a caregiver-inclusive health informatics system designed to support medication adherence while reducing caregiver burden. Using a mixed-methods research design that included fifteen semi-structured caregiver interviews, sixty-five survey responses, and five pharmacist consultations, this study identified three primary challenges: caregiver stress related to uncertainty about medication intake, fragmented communication with healthcare professionals, and distrust in existing digital tools. Informed by the CeHRes Roadmap 2.0 and the Triple Bottom Line by Design and Culture (TBLD+C) framework, as well as recent co-design studies involving caregivers, Adhera integrates a sensor-equipped smart pill organizer with a mobile companion application that records intake events, sends real-time reminders, and provides caregivers with synchronized adherence data. Preliminary evaluation suggests that Adhera enhances visibility, improves caregiver confidence, and streamlines medication routines. This study contributes to the field of health informatics by demonstrating how human-centered design and collaborative frameworks can align technical innovation with empathy-driven care."}

Traditional policy learning paradigms, including both Imitation Learning (IL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), struggle to cultivate generalizability across diverse scenarios. While IL policies often overfit to specific expert trajectories, RL suffers from the inherent lack of a unified and general reward signal necessary for effective multi-scene generalization. We posit that the world model is uniquely capable of serving as a universal environment proxy to address this limitation. However, current world models primarily focus on their ability to predict observations and still rely on task-specific, handcrafted reward functions, thereby failing to provide a truly general training environment. Toward this problem, we propose RoboScape-R, a framework leveraging the world model to serve as a versatile, general-purpose proxy for the embodied environment within the RL paradigm. We introduce a novel world model-based general reward mechanism that generates ''endogenous'' rewards derived from the model's intrinsic understanding of real-world state transition dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboScape-R effectively addresses the limitations of traditional RL methods by providing an efficient and general training environment that substantially enhances the generalization capability of embodied policies. Our approach offers critical insights into utilizing the world model as an online training strategy and achieves an average 37.5% performance improvement over baselines under out-of-domain scenarios."}

Traditionally, EF estimation requires manual tracing and domain expertise, making the process time-consuming and subject to interobserver variability. Most current deep learning methods for EF prediction are black-box models with limited transparency, which reduces clinical trust. Some post-hoc explainability methods have been proposed to interpret the decision-making process after the prediction is made. However, these explanations do not guide the model's internal reasoning and therefore offer limited reliability in clinical applications. To address this, we introduce ProtoEFNet, a novel video-based prototype learning model for continuous EF regression. The model learns dynamic spatiotemporal prototypes that capture clinically meaningful cardiac motion patterns. Additionally, the proposed Prototype Angular Separation (PAS) loss enforces discriminative representations across the continuous EF spectrum. Our experiments on the EchonetDynamic dataset show that ProtoEFNet can achieve accuracy on par with its non-interpretable counterpart while providing clinically relevant insight.

Progress has been hindered by a circular dependency: evaluating hallucinations requires labeled data, yet such labels are costly and subjective. We introduce HalluGen, a diffusion-based framework that synthesizes realistic hallucinations with controllable type, location, and severity, producing perceptually realistic but semantically incorrect outputs (segmentation IoU drops from 0.86 to 0.36). Using HalluGen, we construct the first large-scale hallucination dataset comprising 4,350 annotated images derived from 1,450 brain MR images for low-field enhancement, enabling systematic evaluation of hallucination detection and mitigation. We demonstrate its utility in two applications: (1) benchmarking image quality metrics and developing Semantic Hallucination Assessment via Feature Evaluation (SHAFE), a feature-based metric with soft-attention pooling that improves hallucination sensitivity over traditional metrics; and (2) training reference-free hallucination detectors that generalize to real restoration failures.

The subtle, non-adjacent nature of early disease signals is often lost due to suboptimal architectural inductive biases: 2D/3D CNNs impose strong locality, while ViTs diffuse unconstrained global attention. This conflict leaves the optimal inductive structure for robust, sparse volumetric pattern recognition unresolved. This study presents a controlled comparison of sixteen modern deep learning architectures spanning 2D/3D convolutional, hybrid, and volumetric transformer families for subclinical keratoconus (SKC) detection from 3D anterior segment OCT volumes. We demonstrate that hierarchical attention models offer a superior and more parameter-efficient inductive bias, surpassing the performance of both 2D and 3D CNNs and ViTs. Our results show 21-23% higher sensitivity and specificity in the sparse anomaly (subclinical) regime. Mechanistic analyses reveal that this advantage stems from precise spatial scale alignment: hierarchical windowing produces effective receptive fields matched to the intermediate, multi-slice extent of subclinical abnormalities. This avoids excessive CNN locality and diffuse global attention. Attention-distance measurements confirm a key insight into architectural adaptation: the required spatial integration length shifts significantly based on the signal strength, with subclinical cases necessitating longer integration compared to both healthy and manifest disease states. Representational similarity and auxiliary age/sex prediction tasks further support the generalizability of these inductive principles. The findings provide design guidance for future volumetric anomaly detection systems, establishing hierarchical attention as a principled and effective approach for early pathological change analysis in 3D medical imaging."}

The gripper is driven by a servo-actuated Scotch--yoke mechanism, and includes separator leaves that form a conical frustum for fruit isolation, with an integrated micro-servo cutter for pedicel cutting. For perception, an RGB--D camera and a Detectron2-based pipeline perform semantic segmentation of ripe/unripe tomatoes and keypoint localization of the pedicel and fruit center under occlusion and variable illumination. An analytical model derived using the principle of virtual work relates servo torque to grasp force, enabling design-level reasoning about actuation requirements. During execution, closed-loop grasp-force regulation is achieved using a proportional--integral--derivative controller with feedback from force-sensitive resistors mounted on selected fingers to prevent slip and bruising. Motion execution is supported by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)--based trajectory planning for a 5-DOF manipulator. Experiments demonstrate complete picking cycles (approach, separation, cutting, grasping, transport, release) with an average cycle time of 24.34~s and an overall success rate of approximately 80\\%, while maintaining low grasp forces (0.20--0.50~N).

The unique contributions of blockchain include enabling automation of holding tax calculations and linking the vouchers to the mainstream monetary system via stablecoins facilitated by a series of smart contracts also known as the liquidity pool. The study also finds that there is an inherent trade-off between blockchain benefits and user interface complexity. Hence, balancing innovation and community needs remains a challenge."}

Computed tomography (CT) scans are widely used for lung cancer diagnosis as they can give detailed lung structures. However, manual interpretation is time-consuming and prone to human error. To surmount this challenge, the study proposes a deep learning-based automatic lung cancer classification system to enhance detection accuracy and interpretability. The IQOTHNCCD lung cancer dataset is utilized, which is a public CT scan dataset consisting of cases categorized into Normal, Benign, and Malignant and used DenseNet169, which includes Squeezeand-Excitation blocks for attention-based feature extraction, Focal Loss for handling class imbalance, and a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) for multi-scale feature fusion. In addition, an SVM model was developed using MobileNetV2 for feature extraction, improving its classification performance. For model interpretability enhancement, the study integrated Grad-CAM for the visualization of decision-making regions in CT scans and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) for explanation of feature contributions within the SVM model. Intensive evaluation was performed, and it was found that both DenseNet169 and SVM models achieved 98% accuracy, suggesting their robustness for real-world medical practice. These results open up the potential for deep learning to improve the diagnosis of lung cancer by a higher level of accuracy, transparency, and robustness."}

Our approach extracts low-level representations from high-resolution decoder layers at early denoising timesteps, which transfer effectively to the low-texture structure of HSI. To integrate spectral and spatial information, we introduce a lightweight FiLM-based fusion module that adaptively modulates frozen spatial features using spectral cues, enabling robust multimodal learning under sparse supervision. Experiments on two recent hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches using only the provided sparse training labels. Ablation studies further highlight the benefits of diffusion-derived features and spectral-aware fusion. Overall, our results indicate that pretrained diffusion models can support domain-agnostic, label-efficient representation learning for remote sensing and broader scientific imaging tasks."}

However, achieving semantically controllable dexterous grasp synthesis remains highly challenging due to the lack of unified modeling of multiple semantic dimensions, including grasp taxonomy, contact semantics, and functional affordance. To address these limitations, we present OmniDexVLG, a multimodal, semantics aware grasp generation framework capable of producing structurally diverse and semantically coherent dexterous grasps under joint language and visual guidance. Our approach begins with OmniDexDataGen, a semantic rich dexterous grasp dataset generation pipeline that integrates grasp taxonomy guided configuration sampling, functional affordance contact point sampling, taxonomy aware differential force closure grasp sampling, and physics based optimization and validation, enabling systematic coverage of diverse grasp types. We further introduce OmniDexReasoner, a multimodal grasp type semantic reasoning module that leverages multi agent collaboration, retrieval augmented generation, and chain of thought reasoning to infer grasp related semantics and generate high quality annotations that align language instructions with task specific grasp intent. Building upon these components, we develop a unified Vision Language Grasping generation model that explicitly incorporates grasp taxonomy, contact structure, and functional affordance semantics, enabling fine grained control over grasp synthesis from natural language instructions. Extensive experiments in simulation and real world object grasping and ablation studies demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms state of the art approaches in terms of grasp diversity, contact semantic diversity, functional affordance diversity, and semantic consistency."}

However, existing methods often struggle with the noise inherent in web-collected data and the complexity of unstructured long medical texts. To address these challenges, we propose a novel VLP framework integrating a Multi-Agent data GENeration (MAGEN) system and Ontology-based Multi-Aspect Knowledge-Enhanced (O-MAKE) pretraining. First, MAGEN enhances data quality by synthesizing knowledge-enriched descriptions via a foundation model-assisted captioning and retrieval-based verification pipeline. Second, O-MAKE addresses the difficulty of learning from long, unstructured texts by decomposing them into distinct knowledge aspects. This facilitates fine-grained alignment at both global and patch levels, while explicitly modeling medical concept relationships through ontology-guided mechanisms. We validate our framework in the field of dermatology, where comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each component. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on disease classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks across eight datasets.

Most existing work relies on manual ROIs and rarely reports quality control (QC). We present LM-CartSeg, a fully automatic pipeline for cartilage/bone segmentation, geometric lateral/medial (L/M) compartmentalisation and radiomics analysis. Methods: Two 3D nnU-Net models were trained on SKM-TEA (138 knees) and OAIZIB-CM (404 knees). At test time, zero-shot predictions were fused and refined by simple geometric rules: connected-component cleaning, construction of 10 mm subchondral bone bands in physical space, and a data-driven tibial L/M split based on PCA and k-means. Segmentation was evaluated on an OAIZIB-CM test set (103 knees) and on SKI-10 (100 knees). QC used volume and thickness signatures. From 10 ROIs we extracted 4 650 non-shape radiomic features to study inter-compartment similarity, dependence on ROI size, and OA vs. non-OA classification on OAIZIB-CM Results: Post-processing improved macro ASSD on OAIZIB-CM from 2.63 to 0.36 mm and HD95 from 25.2 to 3.35 mm, with DSC 0.91; zero-shot DSC on SKI-10 was 0.80. The geometric L/M rule produced stable compartments across datasets, whereas a direct L/M nnU-Net showed domain-dependent side swaps. Only 6 to 12 percent of features per ROI were strongly correlated with volume or thickness. Radiomics-based models models restricted to size-linked features. Conclusions: LM-CartSeg yields automatic, QCd ROIs and radiomic features that carry discriminative information beyond simple morphometry, providing a practical foundation for multi-centre knee OA radiomics studies."}

Recent advances in digital twins (DTs) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) offer new opportunities for real-time, data-driven optimization across a vehicle's lifecycle. However, integrating these technologies into a unified framework remains an open challenge. This work presents a DT-based control co-design (CCD) framework for full-vehicle active suspensions using multi-generation design concepts. By integrating automatic differentiation into DRL, we jointly optimize physical suspension components and control policies under varying driver behaviors and environmental uncertainties. DRL also addresses the challenge of partial observability, where only limited states can be sensed and fed back to the controller, by learning optimal control actions directly from available sensor information. The framework incorporates model updating with quantile learning to capture data uncertainty, enabling real-time decision-making and adaptive learning from digital-physical interactions. The approach demonstrates personalized optimization of suspension systems under two distinct driving settings (mild and aggressive). Results show that the optimized systems achieve smoother trajectories and reduce control efforts by approximately 43% and 52% for mild and aggressive, respectively, while maintaining ride comfort and stability. Contributions include: developing a DT-enabled CCD framework integrating DRL and uncertainty-aware model updating for full-vehicle active suspensions, introducing a multi-generation design strategy for self-improving systems, and demonstrating personalized optimization of active suspension systems for distinct driver types."}

However, these failures encode where and how policies can be fragile, information that can be exploited to improve robustness. We address this problem by leveraging mixed-quality datasets to learn failure-aware reasoning at planning time. We introduce VINE, a hierarchical vision-language-action model that separates high-level reasoning (System 2) from low-level control (System 1) under a hierarchical reinforcement learning formalism, making failures usable as a structured learning signal rather than noisy supervision. System 2 performs feasibility-guided tree search over a 2D scene-graph abstraction: it proposes subgoal transitions, predicts success probabilities from both successes and failures, and prunes brittle branches before execution, effectively casting plan evaluation as feasibility scoring. The selected subgoal sequence is then passed to System 1, which executes low-level actions without modifying the agent's core skills. Trained entirely from offline teleoperation data, VINE integrates negative experience directly into the decision loop. Across challenging manipulation tasks, this approach consistently improves success rates and robustness, demonstrating that failure data is an essential resource for converting the broad competence of VLAs into robust execution."}

In this work, we introduce geometric regularization losses into video generation by augmenting latent diffusion models with per-frame depth prediction. We adopted depth as the geometric representation because of the great progress in depth prediction and its compatibility with image-based latent encoders. Specifically, to enforce structural consistency over time, we propose a multi-view geometric loss that aligns the predicted depth maps across frames within a shared 3D coordinate system. Our method bridges the gap between appearance generation and 3D structure modeling, leading to improved spatio-temporal coherence, shape consistency, and physical plausibility. Experiments across multiple datasets show that our approach produces significantly more stable and geometrically consistent results than existing baselines."}

Modern motion predictors offer highly accurate forecasts, yet their integration into planning is mostly rudimental: discarding unsafe plans. Similarly, end-to-end models offer a one-way integration that avoids the challenges of joint prediction and planning modeling under uncertainty. In contrast, game-theoretic formulations offer a principled alternative but have seen limited adoption in autonomous driving. We present Bayesian Iterative Best Response (BIBeR), a framework that unifies motion prediction and game-theoretic planning into a single interaction-aware process. BIBeR is the first to integrate a state-of-the-art predictor into an Iterative Best Response (IBR) loop, repeatedly refining the strategies of the ego vehicle and surrounding agents. This repeated best-response process approximates a Nash equilibrium, enabling bidirectional adaptation where the ego both reacts to and shapes the behavior of others. In addition, our proposed Bayesian confidence estimation quantifies prediction reliability and modulates update strength, more conservative under low confidence and more decisive under high confidence. BIBeR is compatible with modern predictors and planners, combining the transparency of structured planning with the flexibility of learned models. Experiments show that BIBeR achieves an 11% improvement over state-of-the-art planners on highly interactive interPlan lane-change scenarios, while also outperforming existing approaches on standard nuPlan benchmarks."}

At its core is a Spatial-Aware World Model (SA-WM) that learns to reason ahead by distilling the current scene into a command-aware latent state and rolling out a sequence of future latent states, providing forward-looking cues for disambiguation.

However, achieving practical performance typically requires task-specific fine-tuning with large numbers of image-text pairs, which are costly to collect. In this work, we study text-centric training, a setting where only textual descriptions are available and no real images are provided, as a paradigm for low-cost data scaling. Unlike images, whose collection is often restricted by privacy constraints and scarcity in niche domains, text is widely available. Moreover, text is easily editable, enabling automatic diversification and expansion with LLMs at minimal human effort. While this offers clear advantages over image collection in terms of scalability and cost, training on raw text without images still yields limited gains on VQA tasks because of the image-text modality gap. To address this issue, we propose a Text-Printed Image (TPI), which generates synthetic images by directly rendering the given textual description on a plain white canvas. This simple rendering projects text into the image modality and can be integrated into arbitrary existing LVLM training pipelines at low cost. Moreover, TPI preserves the semantics of the text, whereas text-to-image models often fail to do. Across four models and seven benchmarks, our systematic experiments show that TPI enables more effective text-centric training than synthetic images generated by a diffusion model. We further explore TPI as a low-cost data-augmentation strategy and demonstrate its practical utility. Overall, our findings highlight the significant potential of text-centric training and, more broadly, chart a path toward fully automated data generation for LVLMs."}

While recent differentiable rendering methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved impressive photorealistic reconstruction, they suffer from scalability limitations and require annotations to decouple actor motion. Existing self-supervised methods attempt to eliminate explicit annotations by leveraging motion cues and geometric priors, yet they remain constrained by per-scene optimization and sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, we introduce Flux4D, a simple and scalable framework for 4D reconstruction of large-scale dynamic scenes. Flux4D directly predicts 3D Gaussians and their motion dynamics to reconstruct sensor observations in a fully unsupervised manner. By adopting only photometric losses and enforcing an \"as static as possible\" regularization, Flux4D learns to decompose dynamic elements directly from raw data without requiring pre-trained supervised models or foundational priors simply by training across many scenes.

To address this gap, we propose Action Effect Modeling (AEM), a unified framework that jointly captures action execution and its outcomes through a probabilistic formulation. AEM first identifies the outcome of an action by selecting the most informative effect frame based on semantic relevance and visual quality. It then extracts complementary cues from visual grounding and symbolic scene graphs, aligning them in a shared latent space to form robust effect-aware representations. To detect mistakes, we further design a prompt-based detector that incorporates task-specific prompts and aligns each action segment with its intended execution semantics.

Traditionally, high-definition (HD) maps are providing this representation of the static road infrastructure to the autonomous system a priori. However, because the real world is constantly changing, such maps must be constructed online from on-board sensor data. Navigation-grade standard-definition (SD) maps are widely available, but their resolution is insufficient for direct deployment. Instead, they can be used as coarse prior to guide the online map construction process. We propose NavMapFusion, a diffusion-based framework that performs iterative denoising conditioned on high-fidelity sensor data and on low-fidelity navigation maps. This paper strives to answer: (1) How can coarse, potentially outdated navigation maps guide online map construction? (2) What advantages do diffusion models offer for map fusion? We demonstrate that diffusion-based map construction provides a robust framework for map fusion. Our key insight is that discrepancies between the prior map and online perception naturally correspond to noise within the diffusion process; consistent regions reinforce the map construction, whereas outdated segments are suppressed. On the nuScenes benchmark, NavMapFusion conditioned on coarse road lines from OpenStreetMap data reaches a 21.4% relative improvement on 100 m, and even stronger improvements on larger perception ranges, while maintaining real-time capabilities. By fusing low-fidelity priors with high-fidelity sensor data, the proposed method generates accurate and up-to-date environment representations, guiding towards safer and more reliable autonomous driving.

To address this, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have been widely employed to enhancing SAM's adaptation performance on diverse domains. Despite advancements, a critical question arises: can we integrate inductive bias into the model? This is particularly relevant since the Transformer encoder in SAM inherently lacks spatial priors within image patches, potentially hindering the acquisition of high-level semantic information. In this paper, we propose NAS-LoRA, a new Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method designed to bridge the semantic gap between pre-trained SAM and specialized domains. Specifically, NAS-LoRA incorporates a lightweight Neural Architecture Search (NAS) block between the encoder and decoder components of LoRA to dynamically optimize the prior knowledge integrated into weight updates. Furthermore, we propose a stage-wise optimization strategy to help the ViT encoder balance weight updates and architectural adjustments, facilitating the gradual learning of high-level semantic information.

By analyzing the internal behaviors of the state and image token updating mechanism, we find that aggregating self-attention maps across layers reveals a consistent pattern: dynamic regions are naturally down-weighted, exposing an implicit motion cue that the pretrained transformer already encodes but never explicitly uses. Motivated by this observation, we introduce MUT3R, a training-free framework that applies the attention-derived motion cue to suppress dynamic content in the early layers of the transformer during inference. Our attention-level gating module suppresses the influence of dynamic regions before their artifacts propagate through the feature hierarchy. Notably, we do not retrain or fine-tune the model; we let the pretrained transformer diagnose its own motion cues and correct itself. This early regulation stabilizes geometric reasoning in streaming scenarios and leads to improvements in temporal consistency and camera pose robustness across multiple dynamic benchmarks, offering a simple and training-free pathway toward motion-aware streaming reconstruction."}

Our approach identifies dancers within video frames, counts discrete dance steps, calculates spatial coverage patterns, and measures rhythm consistency across performance sequences. Testing this framework on a single 49-second recording of Ghanaian AfroBeats dance demonstrates technical feasibility, with the system achieving approximately 94% detection precision and 89% recall on manually inspected samples. The pixel-level segmentation provided by SAM, achieving approximately 83% intersection-over-union with visual inspection, enables motion quantification that captures body configuration changes beyond what bounding-box approaches can represent. Analysis of this preliminary case study indicates that the dancer classified as primary by our system executed 23% more steps with 37% higher motion intensity and utilized 42% more performance space compared to dancers classified as secondary. However, this work represents an early-stage investigation with substantial limitations including single-video validation, absence of systematic ground truth annotations, and lack of comparison with existing pose estimation methods.

Reinforcement Learning could overcome this gap, but has so far been limited to reasoning with a single visual tool due to the large search space in multi-tool reasoning.

In the teaching phase, we combine demonstrations from a single tool specialist trained via interactive RL with traces from a frontier model using all tools. In the exploration phase, the model further refines multi-tool coordination through continued RL.

To handle this, prior approaches mainly scale the visual generation process (e.g., increasing sampling steps or seeds), but this quickly leads to a quality plateau. This limitation arises because the prompt, crucial for guiding generation, is kept fixed. To address this, we propose Prompt Redesign for Inference-time Scaling, coined PRIS, a framework that adaptively revises the prompt during inference in response to the scaled visual generations. The core idea of PRIS is to review the generated visuals, identify recurring failure patterns across visuals, and redesign the prompt accordingly before regenerating the visuals with the revised prompt. To provide precise alignment feedback for prompt revision, we introduce a new verifier, element-level factual correction, which evaluates the alignment between prompt attributes and generated visuals at a fine-grained level, achieving more accurate and interpretable assessments than holistic measures. Extensive experiments on both text-to-image and text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, including a 15% gain on VBench 2.0.

To address these limitations, we present CookAnything, a flexible and consistent diffusion-based framework that generates coherent, semantically distinct image sequences from textual cooking instructions of arbitrary length.

To address this gap, we first investigate the mechanism of visual neglect and reveal it can be accurately detected via head-level activation patterns in MLLMs. We thus propose V-ITI, a lightweight visual inference-time intervention framework integrating a Visual Neglect Detector that identifies visual neglect via head-level discriminative probes and a Visual Recall Intervenor that modulates activations with prestored visual activation information only when the visual neglect is detected.

In production, the classification pipeline achieves 67% recall at 80% precision, and the similarity pipeline achieves 76% recall at 80% precision. Large-scale A/B tests show a 6-8% reduction in user views of unwanted livestreams}. These results demonstrate a scalable and adaptable approach to multimodal content governance, capable of addressing both explicit violations and emerging adversarial behaviors."}

However, their ability to interpret cartographic maps remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce CartoMapQA, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LVLMs' understanding of cartographic maps through question-answering tasks. The dataset includes over 2000 samples, each composed of a cartographic map, a question (with open-ended or multiple-choice answers), and a ground-truth answer. These tasks span key low-, mid- and high-level map interpretation skills, including symbol recognition, embedded information extraction, scale interpretation, and route-based reasoning. Our evaluation of both open-source and proprietary LVLMs reveals persistent challenges: models frequently struggle with map-specific semantics, exhibit limited geospatial reasoning, and are prone to Optical Character Recognition (OCR)-related errors. By isolating these weaknesses, CartoMapQA offers a valuable tool for guiding future improvements in LVLM architectures. Ultimately, it supports the development of models better equipped for real-world applications that depend on robust and reliable map understanding, such as navigation, geographic search, and urban planning.

First, we fine-tune a point cloud generation model to produce a coarse representation of objects from text prompts. Given the inherent connection between articulated objects and graph structures, we design a hypergraph-based learning method to refine these coarse representations, representing object parts as graph vertices.

To tackle these challenges, we propose an end-to-end framework called Global-Local Aware Scene Text Editing (GLASTE), which simultaneously incorporates high-level global contextual information along with delicate local features. Specifically, we design a global-local combination structure, joint global and local losses, and enhance text image features to ensure consistency in text style within local patches while maintaining harmony between local and global areas. Additionally, we express the text style as a vector independent of the image size, which can be transferred to target text images of various sizes. We use an affine fusion to fill target text images into the editing patch while maintaining their aspect ratio unchanged. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate that our GLASTE model outperforms previous methods in both quantitative metrics and qualitative results and effectively mitigates the two challenges."}

Although recent diffusion-based approaches improve upon traditional optical-flow-based methods, they still struggle to cover diverse application scenarios and often fail to produce sharp, temporally consistent frames in fine-grained motion tasks such as audio-visual synchronized interpolation. To address these limitations, we introduce BBF (Beyond Boundary Frames), a context-aware video frame interpolation framework, which could be guided by audio/visual semantics. First, we enhance the input design of the interpolation model so that it can flexibly handle multiple conditional modalities, including text, audio, images, and video. Second, we propose a decoupled multimodal fusion mechanism that sequentially injects different conditional signals into a DiT backbone. Finally, to maintain the generation abilities of the foundation model, we adopt a progressive multi-stage training paradigm, where the start-end frame difference embedding is used to dynamically adjust both the data sampling and the loss weighting. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that BBF outperforms specialized state-of-the-art methods on both generic interpolation and audio-visual synchronized interpolation tasks, establishing a unified framework for video frame interpolation under coordinated multi-channel conditioning."}

While Vision Transformers that leverage shifted window-based self-attention have established new benchmarks in this field, they are often hampered by a critical limitation: their localized attention mechanism struggles to effectively fuse local details with global context. This deficiency is particularly detrimental to challenging tasks such as the segmentation of microtumors and miniature organs, where both fine-grained boundary definition and broad contextual understanding are paramount. To address this gap, we propose HBFormer, a novel Hybrid-Bridge Transformer architecture. The 'Hybrid' design of HBFormer synergizes a classic U-shaped encoder-decoder framework with a powerful Swin Transformer backbone for robust hierarchical feature extraction. The core innovation lies in its 'Bridge' mechanism, a sophisticated nexus for multi-scale feature integration. This bridge is architecturally embodied by our novel Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MFF) decoder. Departing from conventional symmetric designs, the MFF decoder is engineered to fuse multi-scale features from the encoder with global contextual information. It achieves this through a synergistic combination of channel and spatial attention modules, which are constructed from a series of dilated and depth-wise convolutions. These components work in concert to create a powerful feature bridge that explicitly captures long-range dependencies and refines object boundaries with exceptional precision. Comprehensive experiments on challenging medical image segmentation datasets, including multi-organ, liver tumor, and bladder tumor benchmarks, demonstrate that HBFormer achieves state-of-the-art results, showcasing its outstanding capabilities in microtumor and miniature organ segmentation.

The memory is optimized end-to-end and self-organizes into reusable tooth-shape prototypes without requiring tooth-position labels, thereby providing structural priors that stabilize missing-region inference and free decoder capacity for detail recovery. The module is plug-and-play and compatible with common completion backbones, while keeping the same training losses. Experiments on a self-processed Teeth3DS benchmark demonstrate consistent improvements in Chamfer Distance, with visualizations showing sharper cusps, ridges, and interproximal transitions.

In this paper, we present Motion4D, a novel framework that addresses these challenges by integrating 2D priors from foundation models into a unified 4D Gaussian Splatting representation. Our method features a two-part iterative optimization framework: 1) Sequential optimization, which updates motion and semantic fields in consecutive stages to maintain local consistency, and 2) Global optimization, which jointly refines all attributes for long-term coherence. To enhance motion accuracy, we introduce a 3D confidence map that dynamically adjusts the motion priors, and an adaptive resampling process that inserts new Gaussians into under-represented regions based on per-pixel RGB and semantic errors. Furthermore, we enhance semantic coherence through an iterative refinement process that resolves semantic inconsistencies by alternately optimizing the semantic fields and updating prompts of SAM2.

Additionally, the extensive spatial redundancy and intricate background details typical in remote-sensing images tend to obscure these small targets. To address these challenges, we introduce Multi-Kernel Selection Network (MKSNet), a novel network architecture featuring a novel Multi-Kernel Selection mechanism. The MKS mechanism utilizes large convolutional kernels to effectively capture an extensive range of contextual information. This innovative design allows for adaptive kernel size selection, significantly enhancing the network's ability to dynamically process and emphasize crucial spatial details for small object detection. Furthermore, MKSNet also incorporates a dual attention mechanism, merging spatial and channel attention modules. The spatial attention module adaptively fine-tunes the spatial weights of feature maps, focusing more intensively on relevant regions while mitigating background noise. Simultaneously, the channel attention module optimizes channel information selection, improving feature representation and detection accuracy. Empirical evaluations on the DOTA-v1.0 and HRSC2016 benchmark demonstrate that MKSNet substantially surpasses existing state-of-the-art models in detecting small objects in remote sensing images.

However, as model size increases, the growing memory footprint and inference latency pose significant challenges for practical deployment. Recent studies in large language models (LLMs) show that rotation-based techniques can smooth outliers and enable 4-bit quantization, but these approaches often incur substantial overhead and struggle with row-wise outliers in diffusion transformers. To address these challenges, we propose ConvRot, a group-wise rotation-based quantization method that leverages regular Hadamard transform (RHT) to suppress both row-wise and column-wise outliers while reducing complexity from quadratic to linear. Building on this, we design ConvLinear4bit, a plug-and-play module that integrates rotation, quantization, GEMM, and dequantization, enabling W4A4 inference without retraining and preserving visual quality. Experiments on FLUX.1-dev demonstrate a 2.26$\\times$ speedup and 4.05$\\times$ memory reduction while maintaining image fidelity. To our knowledge, this is the first application of rotation-based quantization for plug-and-play W4A4 inference in diffusion transformers."}

Existing text-to-3D stylization methods typically distill from 2D image editors, requiring time-intensive per-asset optimization and exhibiting multi-view inconsistency due to the limitations of current text-to-image models, which makes them impractical for large-scale production. In this paper, we introduce GaussianBlender, a pioneering feed-forward framework for text-driven 3D stylization that performs edits instantly at inference. Our method learns structured, disentangled latent spaces with controlled information sharing for geometry and appearance from spatially-grouped 3D Gaussians. A latent diffusion model then applies text-conditioned edits on these learned representations.

Deep perceptual losses, such as LPIPS, achieve good alignment but rely on complex, highly non-linear discriminative features with unknown invariances, while hand-crafted measures like SSIM are interpretable but miss key perceptual properties.\n  We introduce the Structured Uncertainty Similarity Score (SUSS); it models each image through a set of perceptual components, each represented by a structured multivariate Normal distribution. These are trained in a generative, self-supervised manner to assign high likelihood to human-imperceptible augmentations. The final score is a weighted sum of component log-probabilities with weights learned from human perceptual datasets.

Existing perturbation methods are frequently white-box and architecture specific. More importantly, while they are often successful, it is rarely clear why they work. Insights into the mechanism of this success would allow developers to understand and analyze these attacks, as well as fine-tune the model to prevent them. This paper presents BlackCAtt, a black-box algorithm and a tool, which uses minimal, causally sufficient pixel sets to construct explainable, imperceptible, reproducible, architecture-agnostic attacks on object detectors. BlackCAtt combines causal pixels with bounding boxes produced by object detectors to create adversarial attacks that lead to the loss, modification or addition of a bounding box. BlackCAtt works across different object detectors of different sizes and architectures, treating the detector as a black box. We compare the performance of BlackCAtt with other black-box attack methods and show that identification of causal pixels leads to more precisely targeted and less perceptible attacks. On the COCO test dataset, our approach is 2.7 times better than the baseline in removing a detection, 3.86 times better in changing a detection, and 5.75 times better in triggering new, spurious, detections. The attacks generated by BlackCAtt are very close to the original image, and hence imperceptible, demonstrating the power of causal pixels."}

To address this issue, we propose a Dual-level Modality Debiasing Learning (DMDL) framework that implements debiasing at both the model and optimization levels.

To address this, we propose CodeVision, a flexible and scalable code-as-tool framework where the model generates code as a universal interface to invoke any image operation, moving beyond fixed tool registries.

We introduce SelfDebias, a fully unsupervised test-time debiasing method applicable to any diffusion model that uses a UNet as its noise predictor. SelfDebias identifies semantic clusters in an image encoder's embedding space and uses these clusters to guide the diffusion process during inference, minimizing the KL divergence between the output distribution and the uniform distribution. Unlike supervised approaches, SelfDebias does not require human-annotated datasets or external classifiers trained for each generated concept. Instead, it is designed to automatically identify semantic modes. Extensive experiments show that SelfDebias generalizes across prompts and diffusion model architectures, including both conditional and unconditional models. It not only effectively debiases images along key demographic dimensions while maintaining the visual fidelity of the generated images, but also more abstract concepts for which identifying biases is also challenging."}

This model uses the ResNet34 residual network as the backbone network and incorporates multi-scale feature extraction. It uses a multi-scale input module as the first layer of the ResNet34 network and an Inception v2 module as the residual downsampling layer. Furthermore, a channel attention mechanism module assigns different weights to different channels of the image from a channel domain perspective, obtaining more important feature information. The results after a five-fold crossover experiment show that the average classification accuracy of the improved network model is approximately 98.8%, which is not only 1% higher than ResNet34, but also only 80% of the number of parameters of the original model. Therefore, the improved network model not only improves accuracy but also reduces clutter, achieving a classification effect with fewer parameters and higher accuracy."}

While existing efficient VLM approaches reduce visual tokens through fixed-ratio compression, they operate passively and lack the ability to adapt to varying task requirements. This motivates a fundamental question: Can VLMs autonomously determine the minimum number of visual tokens required for each sample? Inspired by human active vision mechanisms, we introduce AdaptVision, an efficient VLM paradigm that enables adaptive visual token acquisition through a coarse-to-fine approach. Our model initially processes compressed visual tokens from low-resolution images and selectively acquires additional visual information by invoking a bounding box tool to crop key regions when necessary. We train AdaptVision using a reinforcement learning framework that carefully balances accuracy and efficiency. Central to our approach is Decoupled Turn Policy Optimization (DTPO), which decouples the learning objective into two components: (1) tool learning, which optimizes correct tool utilization, and (2) accuracy improvement, which refines the generated responses to improve answer correctness. Based on this formulation, we further decouple advantage estimation by computing separate advantages for tokens associated with each objective. This formulation enables more effective optimization for AdaptVision compared to vanilla GRPO. Comprehensive experiments across multiple VQA benchmarks demonstrate that AdaptVision achieves superior performance while consuming substantially fewer visual tokens than state-of-the-art efficient VLM methods."}

To mitigate this, we propose Latent Scale Rejection Sampling (LSRS), a method that progressively refines token maps in the latent scale during inference to enhance VAR models. Our method uses a lightweight scoring model to evaluate multiple candidate token maps sampled at each scale, selecting the high-quality map to guide subsequent scale generation. By prioritizing early scales critical for structural coherence, LSRS effectively mitigates autoregressive error accumulation while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that LSRS significantly improves VAR's generation quality with minimal additional computational overhead. For the VAR-d30 model, LSRS increases the inference time by merely 1% while reducing its FID score from 1.95 to 1.78. When the inference time is increased by 15%, the FID score can be further reduced to 1.66. LSRS offers an efficient test-time scaling solution for enhancing VAR-based generation."}

Channel pruning compresses Unet architecture without accuracy loss, but requires lengthy optimization and may not generalize across tasks and datasets. By investigating Unet pruning, we hypothesize that the final structure is the crucial factor, not the channel selection strategy of pruning. Based on our observations, we propose a lean Unet architecture (LUnet) with a compact, flat hierarchy where channels are not doubled as resolution is halved. We evaluate on a public MRI dataset allowing comparable reporting, as well as on two internal CT datasets. We show that a state-of-the-art pruning solution (STAMP) mainly prunes from the layers with the highest number of channels. Comparatively, simply eliminating a random channel at the pruning-identified layer or at the largest layer achieves similar or better performance. Our proposed LUnet with fixed architectures and over 30 times fewer parameters achieves performance comparable to both conventional Unet counterparts and data-adaptively pruned networks. The proposed lean Unet with constant channel count across layers requires far fewer parameters while achieving performance superior to standard Unet for the same total number of parameters.

First, despite pioneering the use of diffusion models in DD and delivering impressive performance, the vast majority of approaches paradoxically require a diffusion model pre-trained on the full target dataset, undermining the very purpose of DD and incurring prohibitive training costs. Second, although some methods turn to general text-to-image models without relying on such target-specific training, they suffer from a significant distributional mismatch, as the web-scale priors encapsulated in these foundation models fail to faithfully capture the target-specific semantics, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose Core Distribution Alignment (CoDA), a framework that enables effective DD using only an off-the-shelf text-to-image model. Our key idea is to first identify the \"intrinsic core distribution\" of the target dataset using a robust density-based discovery mechanism. We then steer the generative process to align the generated samples with this core distribution. By doing so, CoDA effectively bridges the gap between general-purpose generative priors and target semantics, yielding highly representative distilled datasets. Extensive experiments suggest that, without relying on a generative model specifically trained on the target dataset, CoDA achieves performance on par with or even superior to previous methods with such reliance across all benchmarks, including ImageNet-1K and its subsets. Notably, it establishes a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 60.4% at the 50-images-per-class (IPC) setup on ImageNet-1K.

In this work, we experiment with three distinct pre-training, intermediate fine-tuning, and downstream datasets and training objectives to explore their marginal benefits on a small 5M-parameter vision transformer. We find that while pre-training and fine-tuning always help our model but have diminishing returns, intermediate fine-tuning can actually show harmful impact on downstream performance, potentially due to dissimilarity in task mechanics. Taken together, our results suggest that small-scale ViTs benefit most from targeted pre-training and careful data selection, while indiscriminate stacking of intermediate tasks can waste compute and even degrade performance."}

In this paper, we present FRESCO, which integrates intra-frame correspondence with inter-frame correspondence to formulate a more robust spatial-temporal constraint. This enhancement ensures a consistent transformation of semantically similar content between frames. Our method goes beyond attention guidance to explicitly optimize features, achieving high spatial-temporal consistency with the input video, significantly enhancing the visual coherence of manipulated videos. We verify FRESCO adaptations on two zero-shot tasks of video-to-video translation and text-guided video editing.

Unifying 2D videos and 3D motions for simultaneous optimization and generation remains largely unexplored, presenting significant challenges due to their substantial structural and distributional differences. Inspired by the LLM's ability to unify different modalities, our method models videos and 3D motions as a unified tokens sequence, utilizing separate embedding layers to mitigate distribution gaps. Additionally, we devise a sequence modeling strategy that integrates two distinct tasks within a single framework, proving the effectiveness of unified modeling.

Our framework generates perceptually enhanced ground truth images using super-resolution by incorporating adaptive frequency masks, which are learned by a conditional frequency mask generator. These masks guide the optimal fusion of frequency components from the original ground truth and its super-resolved variants, yielding enhanced ground truth images. This frequency-domain mixup preserves the semantic consistency of the original content while selectively enriching perceptual details, preventing hallucinated artifacts that could compromise fidelity. The enhanced ground truth images are used to train a lightweight output refinement network that can be seamlessly integrated with existing restoration models.

By analyzing the internal behaviors of the state and image token updating mechanism, we find that aggregating self-attention maps across layers reveals a consistent pattern: dynamic regions are naturally down-weighted, exposing an implicit motion cue that the pretrained transformer already encodes but never explicitly uses. Motivated by this observation, we introduce MUT3R, a training-free framework that applies the attention-derived motion cue to suppress dynamic content in the early layers of the transformer during inference. Our attention-level gating module suppresses the influence of dynamic regions before their artifacts propagate through the feature hierarchy. Notably, we do not retrain or fine-tune the model; we let the pretrained transformer diagnose its own motion cues and correct itself. This early regulation stabilizes geometric reasoning in streaming scenarios and leads to improvements in temporal consistency and camera pose robustness across multiple dynamic benchmarks, offering a simple and training-free pathway toward motion-aware streaming reconstruction."}

We introduce UniID, a unified tuning-free framework that synergistically integrates both paradigms. Our key insight is that when merging these approaches, they should mutually reinforce only identity-relevant information while preserving the original diffusion prior for non-identity attributes. We realize this through a principled training-inference strategy: during training, we employ an identity-focused learning scheme that guides both branches to capture identity features exclusively; at inference, we introduce a normalized rescaling mechanism that recovers the text controllability of the base diffusion model while enabling complementary identity signals to enhance each other. This principled design enables UniID to achieve high-fidelity face personalization with flexible text controllability.

Observing that motion blur stems from continuous exposure, BlurDM implicitly models the blur formation process through a dual-diffusion forward scheme, diffusing both noise and blur onto a sharp image. During the reverse generation process, we derive a dual denoising and deblurring formulation, enabling BlurDM to recover the sharp image by simultaneously denoising and deblurring, given pure Gaussian noise conditioned on the blurred image as input.

DirectDrag enables precise and efficient manipulation with minimal user input while maintaining high image fidelity and accurate point alignment. DirectDrag introduces two key innovations.

In this work, we analyze the effects of randomness in T2I diffusion models and explore a new format of randomness for TTS: text embedding perturbation, which couples with existing randomness like SDE-injected noise to enhance generative diversity and quality. We start with a frequency-domain analysis of these formats of randomness and their impact on generation, and find that these two randomness exhibit complementary behavior in the frequency domain: spatial noise favors low-frequency components (early steps), while text embedding perturbation enhances high-frequency details (later steps), thereby compensating for the potential limitations of spatial noise randomness in high-frequency manipulation. Concurrently, text embedding demonstrates varying levels of tolerance to perturbation across different dimensions of the generation process. Specifically, our method consists of two key designs: (1) Introducing step-based text embedding perturbation, combining frequency-guided noise schedules with spatial noise perturbation. (2) Adapting the perturbation intensity selectively based on their frequency-specific contributions to generation and tolerance to perturbation. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated into existing TTS methods and demonstrates significant improvements on multiple benchmarks with almost no additional computation.

We first identify and validate a query typology distinguishing between global query and localized query. We demonstrate that while uniform sampling is both effective and efficient for global queries, localized queries indeed necessitate query-aware selection for optimal performance. Building on this insight, we propose DIG, a training-free frame selection framework that adapts its strategy based on the query type. Specifically,DIG employs efficient uniform sampling for global queries while activating a specialized pipeline to extract query-relevant frames for localized queries. Experiments on three long-form video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that DIG consistently outperforms existing baselines and robustly improves LMM performance, even when scaling the input frame count to 256."}

In this paper, we discover that the existing feed-forward reconstruction model, e.g., VGGT, despite lacking explicit outlier-rejection mechanisms or noise-aware training, can inherently distinguish distractor images. Through an in-depth analysis under varying proportions of synthetic distractors, we identify a specific layer that naturally exhibits outlier-suppressing behavior. Further probing reveals that this layer encodes discriminative internal representations that enable an effective noise-filtering capability, which we simply leverage to perform outlier-view rejection in feed-forward 3D reconstruction without any additional fine-tuning or supervision.

To address this, we introduce a novel end-to-end framework that for the first time learns group actions on latent image manifolds, automatically discovering transformation-relevant structures without manual intervention. Our method uses learnable binary masks with straight-through estimation to dynamically partition latent representations into transformation-sensitive and invariant components. We formulate this within a unified optimization framework that jointly learns latent disentanglement and group transformation mappings.

This challenge has driven the development of efficient attention mechanisms, with sparsity emerging as the dominant paradigm. Current methods typically retain or discard entire key-value blocks with binary masks, resulting in substantial information loss under high sparsity. To mitigate this gap, we present Pyramid Sparse Attention (PSA), a versatile module applicable to both video understanding and generation tasks. Instead of binary masking, PSA introduces multi-level pooled KV representations, enabling finer mask granularity. Specifically, each query block dynamically allocates lower pooling levels to critical KV blocks and higher levels to less important ones, creating an informative interpolation between full retention and complete pruning. This design, analogous to fixed-point quantization and classical feature pyramid networks in computer vision, effectively mitigates information loss while preserving computational efficiency under a low compute budget.

However, most existing approaches address only one of these aspects in isolation, as achieving all three simultaneously is highly challenging-for example, long-term memory mechanisms often degrade real-time performance. In this work, we present RELIC, a unified framework that tackles these three challenges altogether. Given a single image and a text description, RELIC enables memory-aware, long-duration exploration of arbitrary scenes in real time. Built upon recent autoregressive video-diffusion distillation techniques, our model represents long-horizon memory using highly compressed historical latent tokens encoded with both relative actions and absolute camera poses within the KV cache. This compact, camera-aware memory structure supports implicit 3D-consistent content retrieval and enforces long-term coherence with minimal computational overhead. In parallel, we fine-tune a bidirectional teacher video model to generate sequences beyond its original 5-second training horizon, and transform it into a causal student generator using a new memory-efficient self-forcing paradigm that enables full-context distillation over long-duration teacher as well as long student self-rollouts. Implemented as a 14B-parameter model and trained on a curated Unreal Engine-rendered dataset, RELIC achieves real-time generation at 16 FPS while demonstrating more accurate action following, more stable long-horizon streaming, and more robust spatial-memory retrieval compared with prior work. These capabilities establish RELIC as a strong foundation for the next generation of interactive world modeling."}

More Demo at https://stablesigner.github.io", "summary": "Sign Language Production (SLP) is the process of converting the complex input text into a real video. Most previous works focused on the Text2Gloss, Gloss2Pose, Pose2Vid stages, and some concentrated on Prompt2Gloss and Text2Avatar stages. However, this field has made slow progress due to the inaccuracy of text conversion, pose generation, and the rendering of poses into real human videos in these stages, resulting in gradually accumulating errors. Therefore, in this paper, we streamline the traditional redundant structure, simplify and optimize the task objective, and design a new sign language generative model called Stable Signer. It redefines the SLP task as a hierarchical generation end-to-end task that only includes text understanding (Prompt2Gloss, Text2Gloss) and Pose2Vid, and executes text understanding through our proposed new Sign Language Understanding Linker called SLUL, and generates hand gestures through the named SLP-MoE hand gesture rendering expert block to end-to-end generate high-quality and multi-style sign language videos. SLUL is trained using the newly developed Semantic-Aware Gloss Masking Loss (SAGM Loss). Its performance has improved by 48.6% compared to the current SOTA generation methods."}

The agentic paradigm promises that VLMs can use a wide variety of tools that could augment these capabilities, such as depth estimators, segmentation models, and pose estimators. Yet it remains an open challenge how to realize this vision without solely relying on handcrafted prompting strategies or enforcing fixed, predefined tool pipelines that limit VLMs' ability to discover optimal tool-use patterns. Reinforcement Learning could overcome this gap, but has so far been limited to reasoning with a single visual tool due to the large search space in multi-tool reasoning. We introduce Double Interactive Reinforcement Learning (DIRL), a two-phase training framework where VLMs learn to coordinate multiple tools through interactive exploration and feedback. In the teaching phase, we combine demonstrations from a single tool specialist trained via interactive RL with traces from a frontier model using all tools. In the exploration phase, the model further refines multi-tool coordination through continued RL. Our model, SpaceTools, with tool-augmented spatial reasoning ability, achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial understanding benchmarks (RoboSpatial-Home, BLINK, BOP-ASK) and demonstrates reliable real-world manipulation using a 7-DOF robot as a tool. DIRL provides substantial improvements over the vanilla SFT (+12% on RoboSpatial) and RL (+16% on RoboSpatial) baselines. Project page: https://spacetools.github.io/."}

To address these limitations, we present PosterCopilot, a framework that advances layout reasoning and controllable editing for professional graphic design. Specifically, we introduce a progressive three-stage training strategy that equips LMMs with geometric understanding and aesthetic reasoning for layout design, consisting of Perturbed Supervised Fine-Tuning, Reinforcement Learning for Visual-Reality Alignment, and Reinforcement Learning from Aesthetic Feedback. Furthermore, we develop a complete workflow that couples the trained LMM-based design model with generative models, enabling layer-controllable, iterative editing for precise element refinement while maintaining global visual consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PosterCopilot achieves geometrically accurate and aesthetically superior layouts, offering unprecedented controllability for professional iterative design."}

Prior works usually suffer from two limitations. First, they add random noise to training samples or VAE latents as data augmentation, introducing complex pipelines including extra noising and denoising steps. Second, they use a pretrained and frozen VAE encoder, resulting in suboptimal reconstruction and generation quality. In this paper, we find that the two issues can be solved in a very simple way: just fixing the variance (which would otherwise be predicted by the VAE encoder) to a constant (e.g., 0.5). On the one hand, this method allows the encoder to output a broader distribution of tokens and the decoder to learn to reconstruct clean images from the augmented token distribution, avoiding additional noise or denoising design. On the other hand, fixed variance simplifies the VAE evidence lower bound, making it stable to train an NF with a VAE jointly. On the ImageNet $256 \\times 256$ generation task, our model SimFlow obtains a gFID score of 2.15, outperforming the state-of-the-art method STARFlow (gFID 2.40). Moreover, SimFlow can be seamlessly integrated with the end-to-end representation alignment (REPA-E) method and achieves an improved gFID of 1.91, setting a new state of the art among NFs."}

We leverage the multiple viewpoints naturally captured within a single life to learn a visual encoder in a self-supervised manner. Our experiments demonstrate three key findings. First, models trained independently on different lives develop a highly aligned geometric understanding. We demonstrate this by training visual encoders on distinct datasets each capturing a different life, both indoors and outdoors, as well as introducing a novel cross-attention-based metric to quantify the functional alignment of the internal representations developed by different models. Second, we show that single-life models learn generalizable geometric representations that effectively transfer to downstream tasks, such as depth estimation, in unseen environments. Third, we demonstrate that training on up to 30 hours from one week of the same person's life leads to comparable performance to training on 30 hours of diverse web data, highlighting the strength of single-life representation learning. Overall, our results establish that the shared structure of the world, both leads to consistency in models trained on individual lives, and provides a powerful signal for visual representation learning."}

While Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising framework, existing methods often struggle with the multi-granularity of tasks (long-term strategy vs. instant actions) and the complexity of large-scale agent interactions. This paper presents a unified Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework that addresses these challenges. First, we establish a baseline using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) within a client-server architecture for real-time action scheduling, with PPO demonstrating superior performance (4.32 avg. goals, 82.9% ball control). Second, we introduce a Hierarchical RL (HRL) structure based on the options framework to decompose the problem into a high-level trajectory planning layer (modeled as a Semi-Markov Decision Process) and a low-level action execution layer, improving global strategy (avg. goals increased to 5.26). Finally, to ensure scalability, we integrate mean-field theory into the HRL framework, simplifying many-agent interactions into a single agent vs. the population average. Our mean-field actor-critic method achieves a significant performance boost (5.93 avg. goals, 89.1% ball control, 92.3% passing accuracy) and enhanced training stability. Extensive simulations of 4v4 matches in the Webots environment validate our approach, demonstrating its potential for robust, scalable, and cooperative behavior in complex multi-agent domains."}

From Geometric to Foundation Models", "comment": null, "summary": "In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of existing scene representation methods for robotics, covering traditional representations such as point clouds, voxels, signed distance functions (SDF), and scene graphs, as well as more recent neural representations like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), and the emerging Foundation Models. While current SLAM and localization systems predominantly rely on sparse representations like point clouds and voxels, dense scene representations are expected to play a critical role in downstream tasks such as navigation and obstacle avoidance. Moreover, neural representations such as NeRF, 3DGS, and foundation models are well-suited for integrating high-level semantic features and language-based priors, enabling more comprehensive 3D scene understanding and embodied intelligence. In this paper, we categorized the core modules of robotics into five parts (Perception, Mapping, Localization, Navigation, Manipulation). We start by presenting the standard formulation of different scene representation methods and comparing the advantages and disadvantages of scene representation across different modules. This survey is centered around the question: What is the best 3D scene representation for robotics? We then discuss the future development trends of 3D scene representations, with a particular focus on how the 3D Foundation Model could replace current methods as the unified solution for future robotic applications. The remaining challenges in fully realizing this model are also explored. We aim to offer a valuable resource for both newcomers and experienced researchers to explore the future of 3D scene representations and their application in robotics.

However, when performing global localization using semantic objects, high semantic ambiguity intensifies object misclassification and increases the likelihood of incorrect associations, which in turn can cause significant errors in the estimated pose. Thus, in this letter, we propose a multi-label likelihood-based semantic graph matching framework for object-level global localization. The key idea is to exploit multi-label graph representations, rather than single-label alternatives, to capture and leverage the inherent semantic context of object observations. Based on these representations, our approach enhances semantic correspondence across graphs by combining the likelihood of each node with the maximum likelihood of its neighbors via context-aware likelihood propagation. For rigorous validation, data association and pose estimation performance are evaluated under both closed-set and open-set detection configurations. In addition, we demonstrate the scalability of our approach to large-vocabulary object categories in both real-world indoor scenes and synthetic environments."}

Traditional policy learning paradigms, including both Imitation Learning (IL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), struggle to cultivate generalizability across diverse scenarios. While IL policies often overfit to specific expert trajectories, RL suffers from the inherent lack of a unified and general reward signal necessary for effective multi-scene generalization. We posit that the world model is uniquely capable of serving as a universal environment proxy to address this limitation. However, current world models primarily focus on their ability to predict observations and still rely on task-specific, handcrafted reward functions, thereby failing to provide a truly general training environment. Toward this problem, we propose RoboScape-R, a framework leveraging the world model to serve as a versatile, general-purpose proxy for the embodied environment within the RL paradigm. We introduce a novel world model-based general reward mechanism that generates ''endogenous'' rewards derived from the model's intrinsic understanding of real-world state transition dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboScape-R effectively addresses the limitations of traditional RL methods by providing an efficient and general training environment that substantially enhances the generalization capability of embodied policies. Our approach offers critical insights into utilizing the world model as an online training strategy and achieves an average 37.5% performance improvement over baselines under out-of-domain scenarios."}

Our approach minimizes changes in image intensity by optimizing over 3D rotation represented in SO(3). This results in a stabilized video, computed in real time, suitable for human viewing, and free from distortion. When adapted to hold a fixed viewing orientation, up to occasional saccades, it can dramatically reduce inter-frame motion while also benefiting from an efficient recursive update. When compared to Adobe Premier Pro's warp stabilizer, which is widely regarded as the best commercial video stabilization software available, our method achieves higher quality results while also running in real time."}
